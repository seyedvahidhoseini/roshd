Your private entry leads to the apartment above the garage, and the garage gets used every night for some local teens to practice their rock music, so it's like you get a free concert every night :)"

The shared laundry is only ever used by me, since I live in the main unit, and I only ever use the washing machine to wash my g-strings (I'm a male exotic dancer) so you'll have free reign in the laundry room every weekday. I think that alone is worth $1250."

    "input": "",
    "output": "I can do $7095 per month and all four of you will have to fill out a rental application.  I will go ahead and waive the $35 credit check for each person.  That will save you all $140 on the application process."

    "input": "",
    "output": "I'll be honest, I just wanna get rid of the mattress along with the frame and night stand. I'd be willing to sell it all for 120$ or I could break the items up for 40$ each. I can include delivery within a 20 mile radius."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Okay that seems like a pretty generous offer. Are you looking to get rid of it because of space reasons or is there something wrong with it?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Its in good condition but does have a few marks and scratches from daily use. I'm looking to sell it because I am moving and have purchased a newer replacement so space is limited to store my old furniture."

    "instruction": "Yes, but there are some important details  you did not mention.  How many parking spaces do we get? And do you allow pets?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Yup, pets are allowed upon approval, but I'm sure as long as you pick up after them and take care of them we'll be fine in that regard. And then, at the moment, there's plenty of ample parking because we have unsold units. We anticipate there will always be at least two parking spots for you, even during busy season."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Well, it's good to hear that you would accept our cat.  And while there is plenty of parking now, we will need at least a spot for each of us.  But how about distance to BART, the transit station? Are you right off Highway 4 or over Willow Pass Road?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Yup, we're very close to Highway 4, so that's convenient, and then in regards to BART I'm not entirely sure, but I can get back to you, I believe we are, sorry about that."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "OK, that's good.  It says High Speed Internet Access. Who is the provider and is that included in the rent or do we pay separately?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "We have XFINITY, which is Comcast, and its included in the rent.  Also included in the rent are the appliances such as laundry, washer, dryer, gas stove and range, as well as a fitness center. Seems like a good deal, no?"

    "instruction": "So both water and electricity are included in the rent?  How about garbage?  And is there a separate fee for using the swimming pool?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Well no, I don't believe any place includes the water and electricity at this price. We'll take care of the garbage and take it out for you, and no, the fee is included for the swimming pool because we have staff that maintain it."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Well, that doesn't sound like a bad deal.  I think we will submit an offer for it.",

    "instruction": "From what I've read, It sounds like what I've been looking for! However, I've been to a few others, and the price is a little high for the area.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The price is a little bit higher than other places in the area, but this apartment has some things most others don't.  10 feet high ceilings, ceramic tile floors, two skylights and even an off street parking spot.  You know how hard those are to find here.  The deposit is 1,500 firm, but I do have a little bit of wiggle room on the price.  Around what price are you looking for?"
  },

  {
    "instruction": "I was told to ask for $50. They are used, correct?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Yes these are used but even used ones are worth much more than 50. Other used ones in worse condition are selling for 150. Can you do 95?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How about we meet halfway. How's $75",
    "input": "",
    "output": "I can't meet you halfway since you started so low. That wouldn't be fair at all. I actually already lowered the price to 100 in the first place. So how about 90 and we have a deal."

    "input": "",
    "output": "I've only had it for a couple months.  I figured it would get a lot of use, but it's pretty much sat on a shelf.  It's only been used a couple times.  I'm looking for 490 for it.  I think that's fair as I'm including a 17 inch LCD monitor and two 150MHz probes.  Is this your first Oscilloscope or have you been using one for a while?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "It's my first. I've used them in the past, but I've never owned one. They're a bit out of my budget! However, I'm very interested in this one. Would you accept an offer?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "I have a little bit of wiggle room, but not too much unfortunately.  When I got this one I went pretty high end.  It has a 100 Mega Samples a sec and can export data to PCs.  It even has internal storage.  What do you think is fair?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I was hoping I could get it for $345. I can assure you it'll be put to good use!",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Hmmm I can't go that low unfortunately.  You said this is your first one.  How about we go 440 and I can spend a couple hours showing you how to use it and can even throw in some replacement parts I have."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I understand. How about $400? That's about all I can afford at this time.",

You are not kidding that I won't find a better deal for that price!  The original $780 you're asking for is entirely reasonable...and your current offer is even more generous.  I hope you can forgive me for all the barter, here, because this request in no way is an insult...it's simply that I'm forced to dip into reserves here...  I might be able to scrape up enough to counter with $425...  Again, I wish I could go higher...",
